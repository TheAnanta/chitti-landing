    <p><strong>OPERATIONS INTERN — INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p>

    <p>&#10003; Handle all assigned subjects entirely through the <strong>Chitti_Architects app</strong>.</p>

    <p>&#10003; Subjects are assigned by the <strong>Admin</strong>.</p>

    <p>&#10003; Coordinate with all SMEs: <strong>Video SME, Notes SME, Cheatsheet SME, IMP SME, and Editor</strong>.</p>

    <p>&#10003; Set and monitor strict deadlines for Notes, Cheatsheets, IMP Questions, and Video Recordings (Admins will also set deadlines).</p>

    <p>&#10003; Discuss and finalize video recording schedules with the Video SME.</p>

    <p>&#10003; Collect necessary recording equipment from Admin: microphone, tripod, markers, duster.</p>

    <p>&#10003; During shoots: verify mic connection, check framing, and confirm audio quality.</p>

    <p>&#10003; Ensure the video recording is continuous with no cuts or interruptions.</p>

    <p>
        &#10003; Rename raw videos before uploading (use the format):<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Example: <strong>1.1 Finite Automata Intro</strong> (Unit 1, Topic 1)
    </p>

    <p>
        &#10003; If there is a need to merge two or more videos, use the naming convention:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1.1 DFA merge 1</strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>1.1 DFA merge 2</strong>
    </p>

    <p>&#10003; Upload renamed videos to the correct subject folder in the app and provide clear editing instructions to editors.</p>

    <p>&#10003; Scan handwritten notes topic-wise using Admin-approved software and collect cheatsheets from the shared drive (verify formatting).</p>

    <p>&#10003; Return submissions that violate guidelines with a clear reason and reference to the specific rule.</p>

    <p>&#10003; After pushing content into the app, thoroughly verify the entire subject content (videos, notes, cheatsheets, IMP questions).</p>
